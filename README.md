# Admin Tools

A simple WordPress plugin that puts update, important site and important server data in one convenient and easy-to-find place.  Monitor one or multiple websites on the go, this plugin makes your job as a site administrator easier by eliminating the need to look through the site and server for the information that WP Monitor stores right on the dashboard.

Special Thanks to Evan Herman
